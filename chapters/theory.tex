\section{Introduction}
Modern particle theory is built upon the twin pillars of Yang-Mills theories and spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
Our best current model, the Standard Model (SM), is built from two Yang-Mills theories: electroweak theory and quantum chromodynamics, of which the former has its gauge symmetry spontaneously broken. What else goes in the intro?

\section{Yang-Mills Theories}
Internal symmetries (global), no conserved current, promoting to local (gauging) we switch on the interaction and we get a theory containing gauge bosons mediating forces. Yang-Mills theories are gauge theories with a generic gauge group G, which can be non-abelian and this is crucial for describing the weak and strong forces.

\subsection{Construction}
Generic description of gauging a symmetry, constructing a convariant derivative, getting a gauge field mediating the interaction controlled by gauge coupling, dynamics of the gauge field from the field strength tensor, how to construct a Lagrangian. An aside on renormalisability of YM theories?

\subsection{Phenomenology}
How the above manifests as particles, couplings and diagrams 



\section{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking}

Solution doesn't obey the symmetry of the theory etc. Example of the ferromagnet with a nice diagram. Requires QFT not just QM. 

\subsection{Gauge Symmetry}
The above in the context of a gauge theory. Talk about U(1) and superconductors. Goldstones from global symmetries, no goldstones in gauge theory, massive bosons, higgs boson. Higgs potential diagram. 



\section{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
More introduction to the SM. Its phenomenological motivation. Its sucesses and failures. 

\subsection{The problems with fundamental mass}
Renormalisation and gauge invariance issues, need Higgs mechanism for heavy bosons, and Yukawas for fermionic masses.

\subsection{The electroweak sector and the Higgs field}
Build the Lagrangian with reference to the above. Introduce the Higgs sector and how it breaks the SU(2) gauge subgroup.

\subsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}
Build the QCD lagrangian, describing quarks and gluons, flavour and colour, why confinement, confinement and hadrons and jets, non-exact symmetries of QCD and pions and stuff?

\subsection{The Higgs boson: couplings, production and decay}
The Higgs itself, what it couples to and why, how it is produced at the LHC, how it decays. Emphasis on the VBF production mode and the diphoton decay mode.
